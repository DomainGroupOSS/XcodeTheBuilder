# XcodeTheBuilder
Logs and displays Xcode build time across days

Installation as usual for building from source:

1. Clone
2. Open in Xcode
3. Run Mac target
4. Close All the Xcodes!

Now in `Window` menu there should be a new section at the bottom with:
* Total Build Time
* Clear Build Time History

Log file `xcodeTheBuilder.log` will be located in `~\Documents`
